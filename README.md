# passAuth
Login authentication using node, express, mongodb, mongoose and basic html (no templates).

This is a simple node app primarily focusing on password authentication, session creation and and password hashing.

I have used express framework over node runtime environment.

Moreover, mongoose is used to connect mongodb.

I have deployed simple HTML pages and not used any template engine just to keep it easily understandable.

NOTE:

Install all the dependencies from npm.

>npm instal express body-parser client-sessions mongoose bcrypt

And run it by 
>node app.js
